Nixvim Items to change
===============================================


Defects
------------------------------------

* [ ] The `python` only package has a failure in the lua code, doesn't work.
* [ ] No support for dlang that I can find, turned off.


New features
-------------------------------------------

* [ ] Disable the blink.cmp when in markdown files
* [ ] Disable the blink.cmp when in a comment for a given language (seems challenging)


Techdebt
---------------------------------------------

* [ ] A few updates are needed for common functions to be extracted.
* [ ] The `claude.nix` file is a bit unwieldy, look to modularize and clean up.
